After escaping from Winterfell, Sansa and Theon flee into the Wolfswood, with the Bolton forces in hot pursuit. They cross a stream and briefly take shelter under an uprooted tree, where Theon hugs Sansa to keep her warm. Shortly after, however, they are found by the Bolton men and hounds. Theon urges Sansa to flee to Jon Snow at Castle Black, but she refuses to leave without him and is found when Theon's ruse is discovered. Brienne and Podrick appear just in time and fight off the soldiers, killing them all. Brienne once again offers her service to Sansa, who this time readily accepts, reciting her vows.[45]

On the way to Castle Black, Brienne reveals to Sansa how she briefly met Arya near the Bloody Gate. Sansa is delighted to hear that her sister is still alive and well. Theon decides to part from the group and head towards the Iron Islands. Sansa implores him to accompany them to Castle Black and join the Night's Watch so his crimes will be forgiven, saying that Jon will protect them from Ramsay, and promising that she will tell Jon the truth about Bran and Rickon. But Theon reminds her that he also killed two farm boys and Ser Rodrik Cassel, for which Jon will never forgive him. Sansa bids him farewell, and the two share a tender hug.[46]

Sansa Reunite&#039;s with Jon
Sansa reunites with Jon.
Sansa, Brienne, and Podrick arrive soon at Castle Black where they find Jon. At first, both "siblings" are too stunned to even speak when they see each other, but quickly share a loving embrace after their long and tragic separation. As Jon offers Sansa food, they reminisce about their happy childhood and how they both regret ever leaving Winterfell. Sansa apologizes to Jon for her dismissive treatment of him while growing up. She then asks him to help her reclaim their home from the Boltons. However, Jon tells her that he is tired of fighting, that he had done nothing but fight since he left the Starks behind, and that he was killed for it. Although Sansa appears to accept his choice, she tells him that she will reclaim Winterfell and the North, with or without his help.

Book of the Stranger 24
Jon reads a threatening letter from Ramsay.
As Sansa and Jon share a meal with Eddison Tollett, Tormund Giantsbane, Podrick, and Brienne, a messenger arrives from Winterfell with a letter from Ramsay. As the new Lord of Winterfell (having murdered his father Roose Bolton), he demands that Jon turn over the wildlings and Sansa. He reveals that he now holds their younger brother Rickon as his prisoner and that, if Jon refuse to accept his demands, he will harm him and offer Sansa to his soldiers when he gets his hands on her again. Sansa insists that they must take the fight to him with the help of the wildlings. Tormund tells them that they have only two thousand men and women in shape to fight, not enough to match Ramsay's five thousand. Sansa refuses to be discouraged and tells Jon that, as Ned Stark's oldest living son, he can count on the loyalty of the Northern Houses. Jon resolves to reclaim Winterfell, save Rickon and take Ramsay down.[47]

Later, Sansa receives a letter from Petyr asking to meet in Mole's Town. Accompanied by Brienne, they meet in a ruined house, and Sansa angrily tells Baelish the details of her wedding night, asking if he knew the truth about Ramsay all along. Instead, Baelish changes the subject, informing Sansa he has rallied the knights of the Vale to help her, along with news that her great-uncle Brynden has recaptured Riverrun. Though she takes an alliance with the Blackfish into consideration, Sansa refuses help from Baelish, warning him never to speak to her again.
Sansa the door promo
Sansa confronts Littlefinger in Mole's Town.
At a war meeting at Castle Black, Sansa and Jon discuss which of the Northern houses they can rely on to support them. As the Karstarks and Umbers have already sided with House Bolton, Ser Davos suggests asking House Manderly. When Jon decides to rally the two dozen houses still loyal to the Starks, Sansa informs him they can add House Tully to the list, but lies about how she acquired the information. After the meeting, Sansa plans to send Brienne to Riverrun, as the Boltons could intercept any raven sent there. Brienne is worried about leaving her alone, but Sansa assures her she trusts Jon and will be safe with him. Unconvinced, Brienne counters by asking Sansa why she lied to Jon about meeting with Baelish. Before riding south, Sansa gives Jon a new cloak styled after their father's.[48]

Sansa and Jon arrive at Bear Island and are summoned before Lyanna Mormont. Jon asks for the assistance of House Mormont in the upcoming battle for Winterfell, reminding her that House Mormont has always served the King in the North whose name is Stark. Lyanna, however, tells him that he is a Snow and Sansa is a Bolton. Sansa says that she did what she had to do, but she didn't want it. Lyanna ignores this. Ser Davos, however, manages to get Lyanna to pledge her allegiance, telling of the coming threat of the White Walkers. Sansa and Jon later travel to Deepwood Motte, to ask for the assistance of House Glover. They receive a frosty reception from Robett Glover, who has just reclaimed Deepwood Motte from the Ironborn. Sansa points out that the Glovers were pledged to House Stark, but Robett says he pledged to Stark and it cost him his home. Sansa and Jon are only able to recruit a few Northern houses and only gain a few hundred men. Jon says they should strike Winterfell immediately, before Ramsay can gather more men. Sansa says they should try and recruit more houses. When Jon refuses to change his mind, Sansa later writes a letter to an unknown party.[49]
Battle of the Bastards 30
House Arryn forces arrive with Sansa and Littlefinger.
Sansa and Jon meet with Ramsay Bolton on the eve of battle. He does his best to taunt Sansa, but she remains stoic throughout. She asks how do they know if he truly has her brother Rickon, knowing what a liar he is. Smalljon answers her question by throwing out the decapitated head of Shaggydog. As Ramsay proceeds to tell the Starks what to do if they want to save Rickon, Sansa cuts him off by telling him that he is going to die the next day and rides off.

As the battle is nearing an end and all hope seems lost, a distant horn is heard sounding in the distance. House Arryn arrives to help Jon and his army reclaim Winterfell. It is now obvious that it was Petyr Baelish to whom Sansa had sent the Raven; requesting more men that were very much needed. Without Sansa's foresight, it is most likely that Jon and the rest of his men would not have survived the battle. With the Stark banners hanging in Winterfell once more, Sansa confronts a bloodied and bound Ramsay in his cell. He tries to goad her by telling her how she will never be rid of him because he is "part of [her] now," but then realizes Sansa has released his own starving hounds on him. At first, Ramsay is in denial, claiming that his dogs are loyal and ordering them to heel, but Sansa reminds her husband after a week without food they are starving, and they begin to tear him apart as Sansa walks away, smirking with dark satisfaction.[50]

With Winterfell firmly under Stark control, Sansa joins Jon on the ramparts as he watches an exiled Melisandre heading south. He tells her that he is having her parents' room prepared for her. Although she protests that he should have it, he refuses because he is not a Stark. Sansa tells him that she thinks of him as one, but he still refuses and that she deserves it both as the lawful Lady of Winterfell and the one who won the battle for them. He then asks her about Littlefinger and whether they can trust him, which she insists that they cannot. Although he understands why she didn't tell him about Baelish, Jon insists that they have to trust each other completely from then on. He then gently kisses her on the forehead. As he turns to leave, a smiling Sansa tells him that a white raven arrived from the Citadel, announcing the arrival of winter as their father had always predicted. Jon returns her smile.

Sansa is later found by Littlefinger in the Godswood. She tells him about how she had prayed in it every day as a little girl, always dreaming about being somewhere else. She then asks what he truly wants, and he tells her what his ultimate ambition is: himself sitting on the Iron Throne with Sansa at his side. He tries to kiss her but she rebukes him. As she walks away, he tells her that although he had officially aligned House Arryn with House Stark, reprisals would come from King's Landing. Sansa assures him that, as he had done in the past, he would always manage to ensure his own survival despite choosing a side. Before she leaves, Littlefinger once again reminds her of Jon's baseborn origins.

Sansa looks at Littlefinger
Sansa glances at Littlefinger as Jon Snow is declared the King in the North.
With the Stark victory, the remaining Northern lords arrive at Winterfell to discuss the new situation in the North. Some, such as Lord Cley Cerwyn, object to the wildlings' presence, but Jon defends them as they had been invited. The lords of both the North and the Vale claim that they need to return to their homes before the winter hits, despite Jon's warnings that the true threat represented by the White Walkers is still coming down on them. At this point, Lyanna Mormont chastises the assembled Northmen for refusing to support Jon in his hour of need. Although she stands by her declaration to Stannis Baratheon that no one but a Stark will rule over the North, she discards Jon's bastard status, instead acknowledging him as having Ned Stark's blood in his veins. With that, she acclaims him as the King in the North, as his brother Robb had been before him. Lyanna's speech is followed by a similar declaration from both Lord Wyman Manderly of White Harbor, and Lord Glover of Deepwood Motte. The assembled Lords of the North and the Vale acclaim Jon Snow as the King in the North. Jon looks at Sansa, and she smiles back at him, but her smile fades when she glances at Littlefinger (the only other person not cheering).</p>
