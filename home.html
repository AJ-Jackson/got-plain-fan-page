Game of Thrones is an American fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. It is an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, George R. R. Martin's series of fantasy novels, the first of which is titled A Game of Thrones. It is filmed at Titanic Studios in Belfast and on location elsewhere in Northern Ireland, as well as in Croatia, Iceland, Malta, Morocco, Spain, Scotland, and the United States. The series premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011, and its sixth season concluded on June 26, 2016. The series was renewed for a seventh season, which is scheduled to premiere in mid-2017 with a total of seven episodes.[5] The series will conclude with its eighth season in 2018.[6]

The series is set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos and interweaves several plot lines with a large ensemble cast. The first narrative arc follows a dynastic conflict among competing claimants for succession to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms, with other noble families fighting for independence from it; the second covers the attempts to reclaim the throne by the exiled last scion of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty; the third chronicles the rising threat of the impending winter and the legendary creatures and fierce peoples of the North.

Game of Thrones has attracted record numbers of viewers on HBO and attained an exceptionally broad and active international fan base. It has received widespread acclaim by critics, particularly for its acting, complex characters, story, scope, and production values, although its frequent use of nudity, violence, and sexual violence has attracted criticism. The series has won 26 Primetime Emmy Awards, including the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series in 2015—when it set a record for most wins for a series in a single year—and numerous other awards and nominations, including three Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, a Peabody Award, and three Golden Globe Award nominations. From among the ensemble cast, Peter Dinklage won two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film for his performance as Tyrion Lannister. Lena Headey, Emilia Clarke, Kit Harington, Maisie Williams, Diana Rigg, and Max von Sydow also received Emmy nominations for their performances in the series.

When we left John Snow, he was betrayed by his own brothers of the wall. Did he survive, or is it the end for John Snow? Game of Thrones opened their sixth season premiere last week by resolving the biggest cliffhanger from season five: Jon Snow is really, really dead. In episode two, however, we got a treat: Jon Snow is now really, really alive. The premiere episode, "The Red Woman," opens with Jon's lifeless body lying motionless in a pool of his own blood in the snow inside Castle Black, with a sign reading "traitor" nailed to a post beside him. Luckily, Ser Davos and other loyal members of the Night's Watch soon discover the treachery committed by Alliser Thorne, Bowen Marsh, Olly, and other officers and bring his body inside. Melisandre joins them and takes a thoughtful look at his very, very dead body. It kind of seems like there's a glint of "I'm totally going to resurrect this dude" in her eyes, but she's too busy suffering a major crisis of faith to do anything about it, and the episode ends with Jon still firmly a member of the undead. In the second episode, "Home," Davos has finally had enough of Melisandre's moping and implores her to bring back Jon from the dead using the same magic that allowed her to give birth to a shadow-baby-assassin. Reluctantly (but luckily) she agrees, and proceeds to wash Jon's bloody corpse and throw pieces of his hair into the fire while chanting to R'hllor. It takes a few minutes, but finally Jon comes to, terrified and gasping for breath. There are still a lot of questions that need answering (Will Jon Snow still be a level-headed, good guy? Is he going to come back as a blood-thirsty, stone-hearted zombie? Will he lose memories of his previous life the way Beric Dondarrion did in the books?), but for now, let's all breathe a sigh of relief that Jon is finally back.

During Game of Thrones Episode 602 “Home,” Tyrion acquaints himself with two of Daenerys’ dragons, the ones locked up in the catacombs, and unchains them. Instead of roasting Tyrion, Rhaegal and Viserion seemingly take to him. The question is why? Was it a coincidence? Did they sense he was there to help them, as Tyrion implied? Or is there more to it?

One fan theory holds that Tyrion is actually the illegitimate son of Aerys “The Mad King” Targaryen, which offers another explanation for why the dragons like him. Is there anything to it? Let’s take a look at some of the possible clues.

Razor's Rant, Game of Thrones, If I look back I am lost
Joanna Lannister and Aerys II “The Mad King” Targaryen:

In the A Song of Ice and Fire series, it’s said that even once Tywin and Joanna Lannister married, Aerys was still infatuated with her. In reference to Joanna, he drunkenly joked about how it was a pity that the tradition of first night, which allowed the king to sleep with new brides, was banned. Ser Barristan Selmy also seemed to corroborate that Aerys took unwanted liberties with Joanna during her bedding ceremony. Aerys’ continued lust for Joanna was a constant source of friction between he and Tywin. It’s possible that, at some point after Tywin and Joanna married, Aerys got his way and bedded Joanna Lannister, whether be force, blackmail, or otherwise. Might Tyrion have been the result of that union?

According to those who knew Tywin and Joanna well, the only time Tywin smiled was when Joanna was present. And when Joanna died giving birth to Tyrion, the best part of Tywin died with her. In spite of Joanna’s death, if Tywin’s love for her was so great, why did he hate Tyrion? His eldest son Jaime is a member of the Kingsguard and cannot marry, meaning that Tyrion is the only one who can legitimately carry on Tywin’s branch of House Lannister. Tywin continually refuses to consider Tyrion his heir, which seems odd given his focus on family and legacy. In A Storm of Swords, Tywin rebukes Tyrion by telling him:

Men’s laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors, since I cannot prove that you are not mine. To teach my humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father’s sigil and his father’s before him. But neither gods nor men shall compel me to turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse.

Tywin wants to be respected, and doesn’t think having a dwarf for a son is respectable. He’s also nursing an irrational grudge against Tyrion for killing his mother in childhood. But this could also be an acknowledgment by Tywin that Tyrion is not, in fact, his son.

Tyrion’s appearance:

Tyrion’s appearance may also provide some hints that he’s actually a Targaryen. The Targaryens are famed for their silver hair and purple eyes. In the books, Tyrion’s hair color is described as a mixture of pale blond hair that’s almost white (it’s more dirty blonde on the show). His eyes are also mismatched: one green and the other black. Tyrion’s appearance contrasts with that of Jaime and Cersei, who have classic Lannister looks: green eyes and golden blonde hair. Siblings obviously don’t always look alike, but Joanna and Tywin were first cousins, so how did Tyrion end up with a black eye and whitish hair?

Tyrion Lannister
Tyrion and Tywin:

In addition to Tywin’s insinuations that Tyrion isn’t his son, he continually lobs insults at him. During A Storm of Swords, Tywin doesn’t hold back. He tells Tyrion, “You are an ill-made, devious, disobedient, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning.”

The “ill-made” crack is especially noteworthy. On the surface, it’s another insult about Tyrion being a dwarf, but it could also be an insinuation that Tyrion was the product of an unwanted relationship between Aerys and Joanna—literally, he was made in the wrong way. Since Tyrion’s birth resulted in Joanna’s death, it’s a double whammy for Tywin.

Tywin’s resentment of Tyrion is similar to Catelyn Stark’s feelings towards Jon Snow. In A Feast for Crows Tywin’s sister Genna tells Jaime, “I once said to your father that Tyrion is Tywin’s son, not you. He would not speak to me for half a year.” Genna was likely referring to the fact that Tyrion’s intellect is similar to Tywin’s, but obviously likening them to each other infuriated Tywin. Catelyn Stark hated Jon Snow because he was living proof that her husband had been with another woman. Did Tywin hate Tyrion because he was a reminder that his beloved wife had been with another man?

Tywin’s hatred of Tyrion’s womanizing is also curious. In Westeros, it doesn’t seem uncommon for nobles to visit a brothel or two (as we see at the end of A Storm of Swords, even Tywin met with whores). But if Tyrion is Aerys’ son, he likely inherited this trait from the Mad King, something Tywin would hate to reminded of.

In addition to denying that Tyrion is his son, Tywin is itching to dispose of him. Whether it’s assigning him to the vanguard in the Battle of the Green Fork or sentencing him to death for King Joffrey’s murder, he wants him out of the picture. Finally, before Tyrion kills Tywin, he admits that he always wanted Tyrion dead, and his dying words are a denial that Tyrion is his son. Another interesting parallel is that if Tyrion is a Targaryen, this means he and Jaime each killed the other’s father.

Tyrion’s fascination with dragons:

There are other clues about Tyrion’s true lineage. Like many other Targaryens, he has an affinity for fire and dragons, which is mentioned throughout the books and the show. Particularly of note is a conversation with Jon in A Game of Thrones. Tyrion says:

When I was your age, I used to dream of having a dragon of my own. Oh, yes. Even a stunted, twisted, ugly little boy can look down over the world when he’s seated on a dragon’s back. I used to start fires in the bowels of Casterly Rock and stare at the flames for hours, pretending they were dragon fire. Sometimes I’d imagine my father burning. At other times, my sister. Don’t look at me that way, bastard. I know your secret. You’ve dreamt the same kind of dreams.

During A Dance with Dragons, Tyrion crosses paths with the red priest Moqorro. Like Melisandre, Moqorro can see the future in the flames, though his predictions are markedly more accurate than hers. He tells Tyrion he sees, “Dragons old and young, true and false, bright and dark. And you. A small man with a big shadow, snarling in the midst of it all.” The dragon is the sigil of House Targaryen. What’s most interesting to me about that passage is that Moqorro is speaking only of dragons and associates Tyrion with them.

Will Tyrion ever fulfill his dream of riding a dragon? It’s said that dragons are very selective about who they’ll allow to ride them, and having Valyrian blood may be a factor. In the books, there’s a character named Brown Ben Plumm who claims to have a little Targaryen blood in him. Rhaegal and Viserion are particularly friendly with Ben, a fact he attributes to his distant Targaryen lineage. Now that we’ve seen Rhaegal and Viserion be friendly with Tyrion, something similar may be going on.

In A Game of Thrones, Tyrion gives Bran the schematics for a specially designed saddle, like his own, that will allow Bran to ride a horse despite his disability. This detail may seem inconsequential, but I believe Tyrion will eventually utilize his own specially designed saddle once again, but to ride a dragon instead of a horse.

Tyrion and dragon
Conclusion:

In A Storm of Swords, Dany thinks to herself, “The dragon has three heads. There are two men in the world who I can trust, if I can find them. I will not be alone then. We will be three against the world, like Aegon and his sisters.” With the Tower of Joy scenes coming up in this week’s episode, hopefully we’ll finally get confirmation of Jon Snow’s lineage. If Jon is the second head of the dragon, could Tyrion be the third?

Baelish returns to Runestone and greets Robin Arryn and Yohn Royce. Yohn quickly voices his suspicion of Baelish's involvement in Sansa's marriage to Ramsay Bolton since Baelish had told Yohn that Sansa was going to the Fingers with him. With the intention of manipulating Robin, Baelish responds by falsely claiming the Boltons ambushed Sansa and Baelish on the way to the Fingers and insinuates that Yohn leaked the information to the Boltons. Robin's first thought is to have Yohn thrown through the Moon Door for this false treason but asks for Baelish's advice on what to do with Yohn. Baelish responds that if Yohn can ensure his loyalty to Robin Arryn, which Yohn quickly gives, that Yohn should be given a final chance. Baelish then immediately follows-up and tells Robin that he has learned that Sansa has fled Winterfell and will likely head to Castle Black for protection, though the Boltons will pursue her. Robin responds that since Sansa is his cousin, that he should help her. Baelish takes his cue and orders Yohn to gather the knights of the Vale to rescue Sansa from the Boltons. This brings an end to the neutrality of House Arryn, which until then had steered clear of the War of the Five Kings.

Later, Baelish sends a letter to Sansa at Castle Black asking to meet in Mole's Town. Sansa travels to Mole's Town with Brienne and confronts Baelish about her marriage to Ramsay, coldly asking if he knew the truth about Ramsay's sadistic side all along or if he was unaware and therefore, just stupid. Baelish responds that he made a mistake "trusting a stranger" but has rallied the knights of the Vale to protect her and that the army is encamped at Moat Cailin. Sansa refuses his help, saying that Baelish cannot protect her - that he cannot even protect himself if she orders Brienne to strike him down - and telling him that she already has Jon Snow's help and they will rally other Northern houses to their cause. She finishes by warning him never to speak to her again. Baelish, as he prepares to leave, tells Sansa of her great-uncle Brynden Tully's success in recapturing Riverrun and suggests reaching out to him for support.

Battle of the Bastards 30
Baelish arrives with the Knights of the Vale.
When failing to rally enough houses to their side, Sansa secretly writes Baelish to take him up on the offer she previously rejected.[36] Baelish arrives with the Vale Knights of House Arryn just when the Stark force is about to be massacred in the Battle of the Bastards, and easily wipe out what remains of the Bolton army. Baelish is present when Wun Wun smashes down the door to Winterfell and witnesses Jon defeat Ramsay in combat. House Stark is subsequently restored as Lords of Winterfell and Ramsay is executed.[37]

In the battle's aftermath, Baelish approaches Sansa in the Godswood and finally admits that his goal is to sit on the Iron Throne with Sansa as his queen. Despite Baelish having declared for House Stark, Sansa refuses to trust him, due to Baelish's tendency to betray those he declares for for his own well-being. He is later present at the meeting where Jon is proclaimed the new King in the North by the Northern Lords along with the Vale Lords and the Free Folk, and eyes Jon with envy as Sansa notices this filled with worry and dread

Once again residing in the Red Keep, Cersei is alerted to Jaime's return and runs excitedly to the port to meet him, but her worst fears are realized when she sees a despondent Jaime standing alone on the boat, with a corpse behind him she immediately realizes is Myrcella's.


Cersei mourns Myrcella
Later, Cersei is comforted by Jaime in her quarters. Cersei finally admits to Jaime that she believes their children's deaths truly are destined according to Maggy's prophecy, since both Joffrey and Myrcella are gone and the only one left is Tommen. Jaime scoffs it off and promises Cersei revenge for all that their enemies have taken from them.[46]

A man in King's Landing brags about revealing himself to Cersei during her walk of shame. When the man leaves the crowd to urinate, the gigantic Kingsguard knight walks up behind him and brutally kills him by smashing his head against the wall before reporting back to Cersei. When Cersei attempts to leave for Myrcella's funeral with the Kingsguard knight in tow, a squad of guards blocks her path; their leader informs her that by order of the King, she is prohibited from leaving the castle, in the interest of her own protection. Cersei demands that they move, but the guards do not budge, even when Cersei's Kingsguard places a hand on his sword. Eventually, Cersei acquiesces and retreats to her chambers. Tommen later visits his mother to apologize for doing nothing when she was arrested and forced to walk through the streets naked, then asks her to teach him to rule. Moved, Cersei tearfully embraces her son.[47]

Cersei and Jaime later visit Qyburn in his lab, where he has swayed some of Varys's little birds into his service, to Cersei's amusement. When Jaime asks Qyburn to order Gregor Clegane to slaughter the High Sparrow and the Faith Militant, Cersei claims it will not be necessary, since she has opted for a trial by combat and again named Gregor as her champion.


Cersei speaks with Tommen
She then orders Qyburn to place his spies all over Westeros to prevent any other Great Houses from benefiting from the Lannisters' disgrace. Cersei, Jaime and Gregor attend a Small Council meeting, but Kevan, Pycelle, Olenna and Mace Tyrell refuse to accept them, with Olenna coldly reminding Cersei that she is no longer Queen. When they defy the council and sit down, Kevan leads the council out, leaving Cersei alone with Jaime and Gregor.[48]

A few days later, Cersei goes to speak to Tommen, only to find he is already being counseled by Pycelle. Despite the Grand Maester's claim that he is simply offering his wisdom to the King, Cersei coldly orders him to leave. Once alone, Cersei wishes to speak with Tommen in private, having missed the past several Small Council meetings. Tommen is anxious to fight the High Sparrow, since Margaery is still a prisoner, though Cersei reminds him of what the Sparrow forced her to do. Although Tommen knows his mother has always hated Margaery, Cersei claims the rivalry is unimportant, explaining that kings and queens must command respect, and the High Sparrow is little more than an idealistic anarchist using the Faith to achieve his goals. After Tommen reveals his conversation with the High Sparrow and knowledge of something important, Cersei presses him for information.[49]

Cersei and Jaime attend another Small Council meeting, this time presided over by Kevan and Olenna. Though Olenna reminds Cersei she is not welcome, adding her repeated humiliations, Jaime defends his sister, revealing that Tommen has been talking to the High Sparrow about Margaery and Loras. Cersei points out the High Sparrow was expecting them to fight among each other, and before the trial, Margaery will perform her own walk of atonement, which Olenna agrees must not happen. Although Cersei promises to destroy the Sparrows for corrupting Lancel, Kevan warns them the High Sparrow has many supporters, and more lives could be lost in the ensuing battle.[49]

Blood of my blood JC
Cersei advises Jaime to follow Tommen's orders.
After his failure at the Sept of Baelor and forced removal from the Kingsguard, Jaime informs Cersei he is being sent to Riverrun to help the Freys deal with Brynden Tully. Despite her brother's protests and anger over Tommen's decision to join the High Sparrow, Cersei advises him to lead the Lannister army as their father intended, confident that the Mountain will win her trial by combat. She kisses Jaime goodbye, reminding him they are the only ones who matter.[50] Cersei visits Olenna Tyrell in an attempt to convince her to stay in King's Landing. She uses Margaery and Loras as an excuse for Olenna to stay, but Olenna angrily reminds Cersei that all this is happening because of Cersei herself. Olenna reminds her of the smug look she gave her when Loras and Margaery were being dragged away by the Faith Militant. She tells Cersei that the universally hated Queen Mother has no support in King's Landing, and has lost. [51] Qyburn enters Cersei's chamber to inform her that the Faith Militant have entered the Red Keep. Accompanied by Qyburn and the Mountain, Cersei confronts the group. Lancel tells her that the High Sparrow wishes to speak with her at the Sept of Baelor. When she refuses, Lancel tells her that it is not a request.

Gregor Cersei Qyburn
Cersei listens as King Tommen outlaws trial by combat.
Cersei retorts that the High Sparrow promised that she could stay in the Red Keep until her trial, which Lancel replies that no such promise was made. When Ser Gregor Clegane threatens the Faith Militant, Lancel tells Cersei to order him aside or there would be violence. Cersei says that she chooses violence. One of the Faith Militant attacks the Kingsguard but his weapon does not penetrate the armor. In response, the Mountain rips the man's head off and tosses it aside and Lancel and his men back down.

Later, Cersei, Qyburn and Ser Gregor enter the Great Hall to find a large crowd gathered for a royal announcement. The ladies in court look at the Queen Mother in detest. Cersei asks Kevan Lannister why she was not informed.  Kevan bars her from standing beside her son and tells her that her place was in the gallery "with the other ladies of the court". Cersei reluctantly takes her place there while the other women stand aside, not wanting to be near her or Gregor.

The Winds of Winter 14
After watching the destruction of the Sept., Cersei begins her torture on Unella.
King Tommen Baratheon starts by saying that the Crown and the Faith are the two pillars that hold up this world, and should one collapse, so does the other. He also says that The Father judges them all, and if they break his laws, they shall be punished. He announces that Loras Tyrell and Cersei's trial will be held in the Sept of Baelor on the first day of the festival of The Mother. After much prayer and reflection, he also announces that trial by combat will be forbidden in the Seven Kingdoms, stating that it is a scheme made by those who wants to escape true judgement from the Gods, and that Loras and Cersei would stand trial before seven septons as it was in the earlier days of the Faith.

As the King leaves, Qyburn tells a shocked Cersei, who had been planning on calling a trial by combat with Gregor as her champion, that his little birds have been investigating an old rumor that she had told him about, and that the rumor was found to be much more than a rumor.

On the day of her trial, Cersei dresses incredibly ornately. She is adorned with fine clothes and all manners of jewelry. However, she does not show up at the Great Sept for her trial, instead viewing the city in the distance from the Red Keep. Unknown to those present at the trial, there is a large cache of wildfire underneath the Sept, placed there by Aerys II at the height of his insanity. Cersei has Qyburn ignite the cache, and shortly before, has Pycelle assassinated, so as to consolidate all power to her.

The Winds of Winter 30
Cersei becomes the new Queen of the Seven Kingdoms
In the explosion, all the Sparrows, including the High Sparrow, Margaery, Mace Tyrell, Kevan Lannister, Loras Tyrell and a number of Kings Landing citizens are killed. Cersei watches amused and the goes on to "confess her sins" including her incestious relationship with her brother, the murder of her husband and the explosion of the Great Sept to captured Septa Unella. Later she gives her as prisoner to the Mountain, so she can be tortured.

Following the destruction of the Sept, Tommen commits suicide by jumping out a window. Cersei orders that his body be burned and the ashes buried at the ruins of the Sept before crowning herself Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. <a href="#top">Back to Top<a/>
